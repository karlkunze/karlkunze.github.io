## ABOUT ME  


GreetingsðŸ‘‹  

My name is Karl Kunze, and I am a PhD Student in the Small Grains Breeding program with [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/). I work on applied breeding projects in both winter malting barley and organic naked barley. My aim with my research to utilize modern breeding and genetic tools to understand the challenges developing barley varieties as viable crops in New York State agriculture.
