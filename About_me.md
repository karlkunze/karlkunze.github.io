Greetings 

My name is Karl Kunze, and I am a PhD Student in the Small Grains Breeding program with [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/) with the  [Cornell small grains breeding program](http://smallgrains.cals.cornell.edu/). I work on applied breeding projects in both winter malting barley and organic naked barley. I grew up in Wyoming, NY and became interested in biology, plant breeding and agriculture based on my experience on my grandparents retired farm and my parents gardening and retail greenhouse business.My aim with my research is to utilize modern breeding and genetic tools to understand the challenges developing a barley variety as a viable crop in New York State agriculture. My other favorite activities include skiing/snowboarding, bird watching, cooking, gardening, a good dicussion on history/politics and once I finish my PhD and this pandemic subsides, traveling again.
