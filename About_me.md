Greetings 

My name is Karl Kunze, and I recently defended my [PhD](https://cals.cornell.edu/karl-kunze) in the  [Cornell small grains breeding program](https://blogs.cornell.edu/varietytrials/small-grains-wheat-oats-barley-triticale/) with [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/). My research has focus on applied breeding projects in both winter malting barley and organic naked barley. I grew up in Wyoming, NY and became interested in biology, plant breeding and agriculture based on my experience on my grandparents retired farm and my parents gardening and retail greenhouse business. My aim with my research has been to utilize modern breeding and genetic tools to understand the challenges developing barley varieties in New York State.
I am current a Post doctoral research association with [Kelly Robbins](https://cals.cornell.edu/kelly-r-robbins) working on statistical modeling of aerial imaging and harvest data of alfalfa over time.

Some of my personal activities include skiing/snowboarding, bird watching, cooking, gardening, history/politics and traveling. 
GO BILLS!
