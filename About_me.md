Greetings 

My name is Karl Kunze, and I am a Hot Pepper Breeder at HM Clause USA based in Davis, CA. I work on increasing efficiency of the Hot pepper breeding program and and integrating genomic approaches to selection for hot pepper. In addition to my profession as a plant breeder, some of my personal activities/interests include bird watching, hiking/nature in general, history, cooking, gardening, video games and snowboarding. I Hope to get back into video games soon, and teach myself some new artistic skills, as well as try to use my _mild_ experience in coding to help with community projects. 

This github website will be a go to for personal coding projects and as a host of my academic work from my PhD and post-doc. I have a non-git hub website that seems to be a perpetual work in progress but now that I have a real job with real time, I will be working on it more.

GO BILLS!
