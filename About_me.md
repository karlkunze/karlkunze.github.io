Greetings 

My name is Karl Kunze, and I am a [PhD Student](https://cals.cornell.edu/karl-kunze) in the  [Cornell small grains breeding program](https://blogs.cornell.edu/varietytrials/small-grains-wheat-oats-barley-triticale/) with [Dr. Mark Sorrellsâ€™](https://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/people/mark-sorrells/). I work on applied breeding projects in both winter malting barley and organic naked barley. I grew up in Wyoming, NY and became interested in biology, plant breeding and agriculture based on my experience on my grandparents retired farm and my parents gardening and retail greenhouse business.My aim with my research is to utilize modern breeding and genetic tools to understand the challenges developing barley varieties in New York State. When I'm not working on my dissertation some of my activities include skiing/snowboarding, bird watching, cooking, gardening, some history/politics. I am really looking forward to traveling again once I finish my PhD.

GO BILLS!
