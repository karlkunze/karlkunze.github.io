--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cornell University, Gradudate School

Field of Plant Breeding and Genetics, advisor Dr. Mark Sorrells

Ithaca, NY

2017 - 2023

Minors in Plant Pathology and Food Science

Dissertation: Genomic and phenotypic characterization of barley breeding in New York state

### Cornell University, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences

Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 
Management of a novel winter malting barley breeding program for the New York State Environment
   
   Ithaca, NY
   
   2017 - 2023

Advanced a double haploid and recombinant inbred population starting with crosses in 2017. We currently have 25 lines being tested for a third year of yield trials and a preliminary yield trial consisting of 200 advanced double haploid lines and 200 Recombinant Inbred lines.
  
Conducted seed dormancy assays and genome wide association studies of 450 lines at two locations over two years. 5 timepoints were measured in 2020 and 8 timepoints measured in 2021. 
  
Micromalted 240 winter barley  over two timepoints at the USDA Cereal crops and research unit in Madison, WI. Malting quality resulted were used to inform selection decisions 
  
Used genomic prediction, linear mixed models, spatial correction and genome wide association studies to advance lines and inform selection decisions
  
### Organic Multi-use naked barley for New York and the Northern United States
   
   Multi institutional project to characterize and develop naked barley for organic US systems
   
  United States
  
  2017 - 2022

Advanced a small population of covered by naked and naked by naked winter barley crosses to develop a naked barley variety adapted to New York conditions.
  
Performed genotype by environment analysis for eight naked barley trials across the northern United States
  
Performed a genome wide association analysis of 250 diverse lines across 13 environments for foliar disease resistance in natural field organic conditions
  
Used aerial imaging of a spring naked barley variety trial over two years to quantify barley growth over time as a precursor for competition with weeds.
  
Initialized a combined nested association population using three common parents across all collaborating institution and five parents specific to NY conditions.
