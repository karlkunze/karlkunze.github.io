Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 
Management of a novel winter malting barley breeding program for the New York State Environment
   
   Ithaca, NY
   
   2017 - 2023

Advanced an initial double haploid population of 500 lines and 800 F4 recombinant inbred lines for selection based on agronomic traits, pre-harvest sprouting and seed dormancy. Currently we have 200 recombinant inbred lines and 200 double haploid lines in preliminary yield trials and 25 advanced double haploid lines in a second year of regional test trials.
  
Conducted 5 to 8 time series seed dormancy tests of 500 winter/facultative  double haploid lines across three locations and two growing seasons. Samples were harvested adjusting for physiological maturity and frozen at identical post maturity states until seed dormancy tests were conducted.
  
Analyzed 240 sub samples of winter double haploid barley over two timepoints using micro malting techniques to determine how malting quality corresponds to dormancy loss
  
Used linear mixed models, field trial design, spatial correction and genomic data to make predictions and selection decisions for advancement.
  
### Organic Multi-use naked barley for New York and the Northern United States
   
   Multi institutional project to characterize and develop naked barley for organic US systems
   
  United States
  
  2017 - 2022

Advanced a small population of covered by naked and naked by naked winter barley crosses to develop a naked barley variety adapted to New York conditions.
  
Performed genotype by environment analysis for 8 naked barley trials across the northern United States
  
Performed a genome wide association analysis of 250 diverse lines across 13 environments for foliar disease resistance in natural field organic conditions
  
Used aerial imaging of a spring naked barley variety trial over two years to quantify barley growth over time as a precursor for competition with weeds.
  
Initialized a combined nested association population using three common parents across all collaborating institution and five parents specific to NY conditions.
