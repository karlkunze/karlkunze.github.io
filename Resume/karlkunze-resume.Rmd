# Experience

## Statisical modeling of alfalfa growth using multi-spectral aerial imaging

- Performed logistical and data management of multi-spectral imaging of 3 alfalfa locations, from stitching to image value extraction

- Used random regression statistical software to model alfalfa growth curves using extracted NDVI values as a proxy

- Experience using open source database breeding software such as Imagebreed and Breedbase

## Management of a winter malting barley breeding program for New York State

-   Advanced a double haploid and recombinant inbred population starting with crosses in 2017. Currently testing 25 lines for a third year of yield trials and a preliminary yield trial consisting of 200 advanced double haploid lines and 200 recombinant inbred lines.
 
-   Micro malted 240 winter barley  over two time points at the USDA Cereal crops and research unit in Madison, WI. Malting quality resulted were used to inform selection decisions \hfill\mbox{Dec 2021 and Jan-Feb 2022}

-   Used genomic prediction, linear mixed models, spatial correction and genome wide association studies to advance lines and inform selection decisions

## Organic Multi-use naked barley for New York and the Northern United States

- Advanced a small population of covered by naked and naked by naked winter barley crosses to develop a naked barley variety adapted to New York conditions.

- Performed genotype by environment analysis for eight naked barley trials across the northern United States

- Performed a genome wide association analysis of 250 diverse lines across 13 environments for foliar disease resistance in natural field organic conditions

- Used aerial imaging of a spring naked barley variety trial over two years to quantify barley growth over time as a precursor for competition with weeds.

- Initialized a combined nested association population using three common parents across all collaborating institution and five parents specific to NY conditions.
