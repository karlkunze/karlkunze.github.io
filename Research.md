My current post doctoral research position aims at examining NDVI patterns of alfalfa varieties across harvests, locations and years. We aim to empirically determine the relationship between NDVI measurements and ground truth harvest and quality data. Accurately modeling NDVI growth curves for alfalfa has foundations implications of understanding phenotypic plasticity of crop systems while also aiming to make more efficient phenotypic selections based on NDVI to reduce harvest requirements.

My PhD research was defined into two major projects and three areas of interest. The principal project was the Organic Multi-use Naked Barley Project. Areas of research include multi-year and multi-location naked barley variety trials, genome wide association of multi-location and year organic diversity panels for disease resistance and measurements of components of weed competitive ability, with a particular focus on using aerial imaging to quantify growth rate.

My second PhD project was two fold, advance our winter malting barley breeding program here in New York State, and research of breeding methods and genetics of winter malting barley. In the past field seasons, I have been using aerial imaging on our winter malting barley preliminary yield trials to determine what important agronomic or quality traits(if any) are associated with aerial imaging, particularly over time. The second large component of our winter malting barley research has been to characterize pre-harvest sprouting, germination, dormancy and malting quality of the breeding population.
