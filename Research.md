## RESEARCH INTERESTS  

* Applied Plant Breeding 🌾

* Genetic Association Studies 🧬

* Malt Quality Traits and Germination🍺

* Breeding for New Environments 🌤️

* Aerial Imaging🚁

My PhD research can be broadly defined into two major projects and three areas of interest. My principal project is the Organic Multi-use Naked Barley Project. Areas of research in this project include multi-year and multi-location naked barley variety trials, genome wide association of multi-location and year organic diversity panels for disease resistance and measurements of components of weed competitive ability, with a particular focus on using aerial imaging to quantify growth rate.

My second project is two fold, advance our winter malting barley breeding program here in New York State, and research of breeding methods and genetics of winter malting barley. In the past field season year, I have been using aerial imaging on our winter malting barley preliminary yield trials to determine what important agronomic or quality traits(if any) are associated with aerial imaging, particularly over time. The second large component of our winter malting barley research has been to characterize pre-harvest sprouting, germination, dormancy and malting quality of the breeding population.
